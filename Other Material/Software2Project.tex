\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Definition - PowerEnJoy}
The requested System denoted PowerEnJoy, is a car-sharing service that  exclusively employs electric Cars. 
\newline\newline
As a car-sharing service it should allow the use of a Car via Reservation, taking it and bringing it back to determined parking areas and paying for the use made.
\newline\newline
The System should allow Users to register so it can authorize them to use the car-sharing services, and allow them to reserve an available Car near their location or on a given address, so they can use it for a ride. 
\newline\newline
The Users will provide their credentials and payment info so all the transactions for the service use are made automatically by the System.
\newline\newline
The System should incentivize Virtuous Behaviors of the Users by providing extra discounts, or fees in case of misconduct, on the current ride. These Virtuous Behavior rules will compensate service expenses for the Cars, specially re-charging costs.
\newline\newline
The System should provide these functionalities based on a mobile and web application that can be used by Registered Users to use the PowerEnJoy services. The System should interface as well with the Car so it can obtain important information from it, like location and battery use, and so it can control its locking or unlocking for the use.
\newline\newline
For any issue that the User may find using the service or also for any incident a User may cause to the service, we've designed a Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) who'll be allowed to check the status of the Cars and Users, and be able to solve any inconvenient presented during the use of the service. 

\subsection{Goals}
\textbf{User:}
\begin{description}
\item [G.1)]First-Time Users must be able to register to the System creating an Account. 
\item [G.2)]Registered Users must be able to login to their Account at any time they want.
\item [G.3)]Users can save his/hers credentials in the System.
\item [G.4)]A Registered User will be able to make a Reservation of any available Car near his/her current location or from an address that she/he can specify.
\item [G.5)]Users that had made a Reservation must be able to notify the System when they are nearby the Reserved Car so the System can unlock it.
\item [G.6)]A User that has made a Reservation must be able to cancel it before 1 hour starting from the time when the Reservation was made.
\item [G.7)]In case an User hasn't started using the Reserved Car at 45 minutes after the Reservation was made, he/she will be notified that either if the Reservation is not canceled or the Car is not used in 15 minutes, the Reservation will be automatically canceled and a 1 Euro fee will be charged to her/his Account.
\item [G.8)]When Users that start using their Reserved Car, they must be able to see their current expenses on the service through a System screen inside the Car.
\item [G.9)]The User must be able to know where the safe parking areas are nearby his/her current location or any address that she/he can specify.
\item [G.10)]Users must be able to finish their use of the Car when leaving it in a Safe Parking Area and exiting the car. The User will then be charged for the use of the service. The used Car will be locked and freed for Users to be reserved.
\item [G.11)]The User will always be notified when any Transaction is made on his Account.
\item [G.12)]Notify the Users that are currently using a Car of any available discounts on their ride if they abide by the 'Virtuous Behaviour' rules and of the extra fee in case of not respecting the facilitation of the re-charging of the Car on site. These extra discounts/charges will be applied on the Total fee at the end of the ride. These rules are:
\begin{description}
\item [G.12.1)]Apply a 10\% discount if the User takes at least 2 other passenger into the car.
\item [G.12.2)]Apply a 20\% discount if the User leaves the Car with the battery at least half-full.
\item [G.12.3)]Apply a 30\% discount if the User leaves and plugs the Car in a Re-Charging Station.
\item [G.12.4)]Apply a 30\% extra fee if the User leaves the Car at more than 3KM from the nearest Re-Charging Station.
\item [G.12.5)]Apply a 30\% extra fee if the User leaves the Car with the battery less than 20\% full.
\end{description}
\item [G.13)]Users can activate the Money Saving option on their Account to be notified of any nearby Re-Charging station on their arrival destination. Leaving the car at the end of the ride t this station and plugging it will register as a 'Virtuous Behavior' and will apply and extra discount when charging the User.
\item [G.14)]Users must have the option to contact a CRM at any moment, the System must provide a Customer Service area that offers a Chat feature within the App or a phone number.
\end{description}
\textbf{CRM:}
\begin{description}
\item [G.15)]CRM must be able to log in into the System with an Account and see a list of all the Cars available, reserved, in use or unavailable.
\item [G.16)]CRM has to be able to receive User Reports via chat or outside the app via phone call and be able to register it to the System.
\item [G.17)]CRM upon request form an User or any major cause can Reserve or cancel any active Reservation.
\item [G.18)]CRM must be able to change the Status of a Car given a User Report and tag it, in case it's unavailable, if it's due to Re-Charge, Fix, or Removal.
\item [G.19)]Upon the completion of an User Report CRM must be able to apply extra fees or refund the payment to any User in case the situation demands it.
\end {description}
\subsection{Glossary}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{First-Time User:} A User that has not created an Account and thus has not yet been registered by the System. Can have a client version of the application, but he/she can't use the service until Registered.
\item \textbf{Registered User/Users:} A User that has provided valid credentials and payment information to create an Account in the System.
\item \textbf{Account:} Allows the Registered User or the CRM to authenticate to the System and access the car-sharing service.
\item \textbf{Car:} An electric motored vehicle registered to the PowerEnJoy car-sharing service and thus interfaced to the System. It can be available for reservation, reserved, ready to use, on use and unavailable.
\item \textbf{Reservation:} Option for the User to denote their future use of an available Car. Once activated it marks the Car as Reserved and is active until the User starts the use of the Car or until 1 hour after its activation, at which point it's cancelled and an user fee is applied.
\item \textbf{Ride:} The actual use of the Car by the User. It starts when the User ignites the Car engine for the first time and it ends when the car is parked in a safe area and the User exits the Car.
\item \textbf{Safe Parking Area:} Pre-defined areas by the System where a Car can be left by the User to be able to finish their ride.
\item \textbf{Fee:} Amount of money that is due by the User for any of the System services or for any User misbehavior.
\item \textbf{Transaction:} Any exchange of money made by the System on the User Account, every fee payment is a transaction.
\item \textbf{Re-Charging Station:} Special stations where the Cars can be left and plugged in to have their battery re-charged. They count as Safe Parking Areas.
\item \textbf{Virtuous Behavior Rule:} Any of the incentive rules that provide the user with a discount on their current ride if they follow it.
\item \textbf{Status of the Car:} It is the name of a check list made by the carâ€™s System at the end of each ride. This check list consists in the status of battery, the number of passengers on the car, if the car is plugged on a recharge station and their localization.
\item \textbf{CRM:} or Customer Relationship Manager will be an employee able to Log in to the System with special privileges to update reservation, car status, transactions, etc. in order fix any eventuality an User may find during his/her use of the service.
\item \textbf{User Report:} A User that has contacted a CRM or a major cause that would create a problem in the System will register into the system as a User Report, made by a CRM. This Report can describe for example an incident, a defect during the ride or a Car that has been fined, and will include if necessary a fine or a refund to the User depending on the case.
\item \textbf{App:}  Smartphone application that does the interface between the User and the System.
\item \textbf{Main Page:} A page within the app where a map is showed centered in the users position.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Domain Assumptions}
As not all aspects of the given world are considered in the problem definition, the following domain assumptions will be made so they hold for the entirety of the project.
\begin{itemize}
\item Once Users have registered with valid payment information, all payments made with their Account will be valid and arrive successfully.
\item GPS locations on Users and Cars will always be valid.
\item Available Cars will be always in good working conditions.
\item Users that have made a Reservation will always be able to follow its status until the end of the ride, meaning that the screen on the Car will stay functional or by defect their use of the mobile app will not be interrupted by missing connection or empty battery on their mobile device.
\item The Cars will be equipped with weight sensors on each seat so it can detect how many passengers they are on a ride as well as being able to issue seat belt warnings.
\item All Cars on the service will be at least 5 seat Cars so the option to take 2 passengers or more is always available.
\item All Available Cars will have at least 20\% battery left, all Cars not available because of low battery will be alerted by a CRM and will be moved by the service personnel to a Re-Charge station by the end of the day. 
\item Reservations take immediate effect so no conflict of concurrency can happen for a Car, it cannot belong to more than one Reservation at once.
\item CRM will be employees of the service that will be registered directly into the database, the System does not need to allow the option for them to Register. 
\item CRM will be working in an office able to login to the web application of the System, with an office phone available and we assume there will be at least one available at every hour the Service is working. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Use Cases Description}
Use Cases derived from the Scenarios previously detailed and based on the Use Case Diagram.
\begin{center}
\rule{8cm}{0.4pt}
\end{center}
\textbf{Use Case:} First Time User Registers.
\newline
\textbf{Actors:} User
\newline
\textbf{Flow of Events:}
\begin{itemize}
\item User selects the Sign-Up option on the App.
\item A form is presented to the User where he/she can fill her/his information.
\item The User inserts all credentials and valid payment options and proceeds with the operation.
\item The System informs the User the success of the Registration.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Exit Conditions:} The System confirms the creation of the new User and adds its Account to the Database. An email with the User's Password is sent for her/him to Log in.
\newline
\textbf{Exceptions:} The User inserts invalid data so the System can't confirm the Registration.
\newline

\begin{center}
\rule{8cm}{0.4pt}
\end{center}
\textbf{Use Case:} User Reserves and Rides a Car.
\newline
\textbf{Actors:} User
\newline
\textbf{Flow of Events:}
\begin{itemize}
\item User Logs In to the App in a mobile device.
\item User sees in the Main Page the map with the available Cars near the User current Location.
\item User selects a Car and reserves it.
\item The System creates a Reservation with the User and the Car, maked now as reserved.
\item User moves toward the Location of the Reserved Car and ask the System to unlock it.
\item The System confirms that the User and the Car location are the same and unlocks the Car.
\item As soon as the User ignites the Car the System starts the registration of the Ride.
\item The User arrives to the desired destination and parks the Car in a Safe Parking Area.
\item The System asks the User if he/she desires to finish the Ride.
\item When the User confirms, the System ends the Ride and charges its fee to the User Account. 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Exit Conditions:} The System verifies the Status of the Car and sends an email to the User with the information of the ride as the route and the Transaction.
\newline 
\textbf{Exceptions:} The User cannot find an available Car, the User cancels the Reservation or the User does not park in a Safe Parking Area, thus the System cannot end the Ride.
\newline
