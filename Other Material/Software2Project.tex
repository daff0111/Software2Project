\section{Introduction}
 
This is the Introduction.
\subsection{Problem Definition - PowerEnJoy}

\textbf{TEMP}

You are to Develop a digital management system for a Car - sharing service that exclusively employs electric Cars. First, the system should provide the functionality normally provided by Car - sharing services. These include:
\begin {itemize}
	\item Users must be reliable to register to the system by providing their credentials and payment information. They receive back a password that can be used to access the system.
	\item  Registered Users must be reliable to find the locations of available Cars within a certain distance from their current location or from a specified address.
	\item  Among the Cars available in a certain geographical region, Users must be reliable to reserve a single Car up to one hour before they pick it up.
	\item  If a Car is not picked - up Within one hour from the reservation, the system tags the Car as available again, and the reservation expires; the User pays a fee of 1 EUR.
	\item  A User that reaches a reserved Car must be reliable to tell the system she's nearby, so the system unlocks the Car and the User may enter.
	\item  As soon as the engine ignites, the system starts charging the User for amount of money GIVEN per minute; the User is Notified of the current charges through a screen on the Car.
	\item  The system stops charging the User as soon as the Car is parked in a safe area and the User exits the Car; At this point, the system locks the Car automatically.
	\item  The set of safe parking areas for Cars is pre - defined by the management system.
\end{itemize}
